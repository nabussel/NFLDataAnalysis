# üèà NFL Combine Clustering Analysis (2008‚Äì2022)

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to **NFL Combine data (2008‚Äì2022)** in order to identify performance-based player archetypes. By leveraging **K-means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, the analysis uncovers distinct groups of athletes based solely on **physical and athletic metrics** ‚Äî without using position labels.

The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can reveal **hidden patterns** in sports performance data, with potential applications in **scouting, player evaluation, and strategy development**.

## Key Findings
- **Optimal clustering at k = 2**, validated with both the **Elbow** and **Silhouette** methods  
- **Two distinct athletic archetypes emerged**:  
  - **Cluster 1:** Speed & agility profiles (e.g., WR, CB, S)  
  - **Cluster 2:** Size & strength profiles (e.g., TE, LB, QB)  
- **Strong alignment with real-world positions** despite position labels being excluded  
- **PCA and radar plots** provided clear interpretation of cluster separation

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** ‚Äì data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì K-means clustering, PCA, feature scaling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** ‚Äì data visualization
